# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains documentation about Secular Waldensian Values - a framework derived from 800+ years of Waldensian historical experience, now adapted for modern secular contexts. The repository includes both source documentation and a multilingual web visualization.

## Project Structure

- `secular-waldensian-values.md` - The primary source document containing the complete framework of Waldensian-inspired secular values, historical context, and modern applications
- `waldensian-values.html` - Interactive web visualization with bilingual support (English/Spanish)
- `data.json` - Structured data containing all content in multiple languages
- `candle.png` - Logo/favicon representing the motto "lux lucet in tenebris" (the light shines in the darkness)
- `candle.gif` - Animated version of the logo
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance document

## Content Architecture

The values framework is organized into three main sections:

1. **Core Values** (12 principles) - Each value includes historical roots and modern interpretation
2. **Historical Context** - Origins from 12th-century Lyon through diaspora communities
3. **Modern Applications** - Practical implementations across personal, professional, community, and social innovation contexts

## Web Visualization

The HTML file provides an interactive presentation of the values with:

- **Bilingual support**: English and Spanish translations accessible via flag icons (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§/ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸)
- **Responsive design**: Follows Shadcn UI design system with dark theme
- **Interactive elements**: Hover tooltip for Latin motto translation
- **Logo integration**: Candle symbolism representing "lux lucet in tenebris"
- **Structured layout**: 12 value cards with color-coded accents, historical context, and modern applications

## Data Structure

The JSON file uses language codes at the top level (`en`, `es`) making it easy to add more languages. Each language contains:

- Meta information (title, motto translation, subtitle)
- 12 core values with descriptions and accent colors
- Historical context and modern applications sections
- Footer text

## Development Notes

This is primarily a documentation-focused repository. The content serves as a reference framework for:

- Ethical decision-making systems
- Agent prompting frameworks
- Community governance models
- Secular value-based initiatives

When working with this content, maintain the balance between historical authenticity and modern applicability that characterizes the Waldensian approach to adaptive resilience. The web visualization should preserve the clean, professional aesthetic while ensuring accessibility across languages and devices.
